This is a web application made to help school faculties and students to check information about people and class schedule in school. This is a rookie's practice and definite not pracitical useful since there is no administrative control thus may cause privacy issue.

You may check tables before tests for it makes test more easier.

### Conclusion

â€‹	I did all my best to utilize the knowledge I learned in this class and get this application working fine though it's not qutie decent to show off. I am really happy to see a live web application running on my school server. All the efforts like working around workbench and solving issues of db instance are just worth. Though my first project on database with front-end is not pratically useful. I am still grateful to know a liitle about what real world works. If I had more time on this project, I would add and adjust more relationships and data to make this database more real. And, during learning HTML and CSS, I find they are very interesting and easy to use. I'd make my UI more beautiful given more time to design.
